# CMPG-323-Project3-35124776
In this project, I was given an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that needed 
to be enhanced and improved. Therefore, I: 
  * used .NET CORE MVC Application 
  * Applied Design Pattern
  * Published the App to the service hosted on Azure and ensured that the App is secure and accessible

# This is how the user would use the App
  * The user would use this url(https://cmpg323webapplication1.azurewebsites.net) to navigate to the hosted web application.
  * The user can Register their own account and login with their provided credentials.
