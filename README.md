# CMPG-323-Project3-35124776
In this project, I was given an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that needed 
to be enhanced and improved. Therefore, I: 
  * used .NET CORE MVC Application 
  * Applied Design Pattern
  * Published the App to the service hosted on Azure and ensured that the App is secure and accessible

# This is how the user would use the App
  * The user would use this url(https://cmpg323webapplication1.azurewebsites.net) to navigate to the hosted web application.
  * The user can Register their own account and login with their provided credentials.
  * Or the user can use the provided Login credentials. 
  * Once logged in, the Zones, Categories and Devices tabs will be available to the user. 
  * The user will use the "+" icon to Add Zones, Categories and Devices.
  * T he user will use the pencil icon to Edit the existing Zones, Categories and Devices.
  * Delete existing Zones, Categories and Devices on the web app from the database.
  * View existing Zones, Categories and Devices on the Web App. 
  * All the entries will be saved and stored in the database database. 
  * Once you have added, edited or deleted all the Zones, Categories and Devices you want, you can then log out using the logout button on the menu tab.

# Security
  To nsure that no credentials are stored on GitHub, I used the gitignore file to store any sensitive information
